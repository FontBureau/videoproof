# Video Proof

Experimental tools for creating animated proofs for variable fonts.

https://videoproof.typenetwork.com/
SOME DEVELOPERS need more sophisticated composition tools for variable fonts; To exercise, proof and, annotate, demo and share

CREATE AND DEMONSTRATE options for integration of registered and parametric axes with the value systems and processes of composition and composers.

>Proof and adjust the integration via a combination of css, js, and Ui developments

>Analyze both visually and with filtering and sorting of the data-rich CSS environment now available 

>Annotate issues on glyp, gvar, gpos and other font tables uses with css, js in compostion.

>Share via fonts, css, js, urls of still and motion proofs notes and code.

And this should be done with the option of a limited number of inputs from the user, or have access to all composition variables.

Typetools was developed as a web-based proofing tool for variable fonts made to test fonts during development and in simulated web use for static instances of fonts.

The variable fonts it was made to test, include those made to  specifications for additional registration of axes proposed by TN, summarized here as containing parametric and registered axes.

Development showed users needed the composition formats, sliders, and other options that are currently evident and defined in the user documentation.

User experience showed a repeated user journey including use of sliders to examine a variable font’s designspace, and the need to capture and communicate locations and ranges of design space within the designspace.

Other develpers have confirmed the usefulness of tagging "KEYFRAMES" of varible instances ranges relative to composition of responsive pages.

Development is only a month old and all development is only a month old and all big reports and suggestions are welcome.
